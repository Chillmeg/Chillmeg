# Hi, I’m Qilmeg d(￣ω￣)b

I’m a computational designer and researcher working with 3D capture and XR. 

## A few things I’ve been making
- 3D capture studies, photogrammetry and Gaussian splat workflows
- PlaybackXR, a web based space for exploring 3D captures
- Re-Membering, small physical triggers for spatial stories
